## Types of Data Collected
### Recorded Microphone Audio
- Choona records microphone audio only while the app is in use and the tuner is active.
- Permission to record audio must first be explicitly granted by the user, and no microphone audio is collected or recorded otherwise.
- This audio is processed on-device, in real-time by the app to determine the pitch of the playing audio in order to help you tune your instrument strings.
- Microphone audio is never stored on-device or sent to any remote or third-party server.
- Permission to record microphone audio can be revoked for the app at any point via the device's settings.
